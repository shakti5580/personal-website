            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Shakti, and I'm an 18-year-old student living in Surat. I'm currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at Bhagwan Mahavir University, where I'm in my first year.

Hobbies and Interests
I have a strong passion for internet surfing and am always eager to learn anything that can be useful in my academic and personal life. My curiosity drives me to explore new topics and gain knowledge in various fields.

Geopolitics Enthusiast
In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a keen interest in geopolitics. Understanding global events and their implications fascinates me, and I spend a significant amount of time keeping up with current affairs and analyzing geopolitical trends.

Aspiring Army Officer
One of my long-term goals is to join the army as an officer. I am deeply motivated by a desire to contribute to my country and serve in a capacity that makes a significant impact. Becoming an army officer would allow me to combine my leadership skills, discipline, and sense of duty to make a meaningful difference.

Academic Journey
As a first-year BTech student in Computer Science and Engineering, I am enthusiastic about delving into the world of technology and engineering. I am looking forward to developing my skills and working on exciting projects that will help me grow both academically and professionally.
